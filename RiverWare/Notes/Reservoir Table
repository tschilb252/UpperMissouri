# Upper Missouri RiverWare model table updates

Ruby Reservoir - Max Release table
Teton Bynum - Max Release table

Ackley - elevation-storage table is missing a value for 4324
Left it out for now as storage (found from extending the trendline)
would be large, and values already exist in other tables about the
max storage found in the Res Data object.

Bair - max release starts at 5320, but elev-volume table has 0 storage at 5241
max release goes to 5340, storage goes to 5345 and elev-area goes to 5335 - kept
all the same for now

Clark Canyon - added a row to Max Release table (found from extending the trendline)
to match the elev-volume and elev-area tables max elevation - 5571.9ft 2622.8cfs

Deadmans - added rows to Max Release and elev-area tables to match lowest elevation
in elev-volume table

Ennis - good

Flatwillow - good, Max Release table elevation range is larger than others,
but should be fine (0-2950 vs 2855-2905)

Four Horns - good

Gibson - added 4550	0 row to the Max Release table

Hebgen - added 6450 0 rows to the Max Release and elev-area tables

Helena Valley - good

Hyalite Res - added 6620 rows to the Max Release and elev-volume tables
0 and 1

Jefferson Willow Creek - added 4744.5	1219.688 to elev-area table and
fixed elev in first row of Max Release table

Lake Francis - good

Lima - added a row to the Max Release table 6600 1000, though it shouldn't
matter as this elev is much higher than the max storage in the Res data object

Lower RRL - added 6604 0 to elev-volume table and changed pool elevation
in Max Release table to 6640 in second row

Lower Two Medicine Lake - check Max Release table as it decreases from
700 at 4890 to 628.02 at 4898
also check elev-area and elev-volume tables
elev-area table says surface area of 280 at 4850 but elev-volume says
volume of 0 at 4854

Martinsdale - added row from extending trendline to elev-volume table, 4789	34207.52

Newlan Creek Res - updated elev in last row of Max Release table to 5285
added row to elev-area table 5285	352.7735

Nilan - good, Max Release table range is larger than elev-volume or elev-area tables
